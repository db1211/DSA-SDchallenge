### Problem 1: Plus One
```
Given a number represented as an array of digits, add 1 to it.

The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is 
at the head of the array.

Example 1:
Input: digits = [1, 2, 3]
Output: [1, 2, 4]
Explanation: 123 + 1 = 124

Example 2:
Input: digits = [9, 9, 9]
Output: [1, 0, 0, 0]
Explanation: 999 + 1 = 1000

Example 3:
Input: digits = [1, 9, 9]
Output: [2, 0, 0]
Explanation: 199 + 1 = 200
```

**Hint:** Start from the last digit. Handle the carry!

### Problem 2: Move Zeroes
```
Given an array nums, move all 0's to the END while maintaining 
the relative order of non-zero elements.

Must do this IN-PLACE without making a copy of the array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12]
Output: [1, 3, 12, 0, 0]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0, 0, 1]
Output: [1, 0, 0]

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3]
Output: [1, 2, 3]  (no zeros, nothing changes)
