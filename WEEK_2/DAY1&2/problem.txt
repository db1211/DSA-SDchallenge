Given an array nums, find the maximum difference between any 
two elements where the larger element comes AFTER the smaller one.

Return -1 if no valid pair exists.

Input: nums = [2, 3, 10, 6, 4, 8, 1]
Output: 8
Explanation: 10 - 2 = 8 (max difference, 10 comes after 2)

Input: nums = [7, 9, 5, 6, 3, 2]
Output: 2
Explanation: 9 - 7 = 2 (only valid pair where larger comes after)

Input: nums = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
Output: -1
Explanation: Array is decreasing, no valid pair exists



Given an array nums and a target, count how many pairs 
of elements add up to the target.

Each element can only be used once per pair.


Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 3], target = 6
Output: 2
Explanation: (2,4) and (3,3) both sum to 6


Input: nums = [1, 1, 1, 1], target = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Two pairs of (1,1)


Intersection of Two Arrays

Given two arrays nums1 and nums2, return an array of 
their common elements. Each element should appear only once.

Input: nums1 = [1, 2, 2, 1], nums2 = [2, 2]
Output: [2]

Input: nums1 = [4, 9, 5], nums2 = [9, 4, 9, 8, 4]
Output: [4, 9] (order doesn't matter)
